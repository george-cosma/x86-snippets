# x86-snippets README

A handfuld of code snippets for intel x86 32-bit assembly for use with NASM. It's not much, but I use these handful of times, and I thought the world at large might enjoy using them too, if for whatever reason you are programming in assembly (and 32-bit at that!).  

## Features

- `do-while` and reverse `do-while` loop
- `while` and reverse `while` loop
- A macro for inserting a handful of `helper macros` for managing volatile/non-volatile registers. Useful for one-shot small programs. Use a dedicated file for larger projects, please!
